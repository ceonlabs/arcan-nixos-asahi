.SH NAME
arcan-cfgfs \- FUSE file system driver for window manager automation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arcan-cfgfs [OPTIONS] --control=/path/to/control /path/to/mount

.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool provides a FUSE (userspace filesystem) module for the simple line
protocol used by durden and other window managers to provide an interface
for external control and testing. It is still in an early stage, and breaking
changes might occur.

The contents of the filesystem will vary with the window manager, and some
configuration in the window manager itself might be needed for the feature
to be accessible.

.SH PERFORMANCE NOTES
At the moment, this is quite slow. The actual response time of the commands
will vary with the refresh rate of the display. There are two big factors that
contribute to this problem, one fixable and another inherent to the design.

The inherent problem is that all filesystem operations are aligned to the state
of the active output displays. Since there is an intimate relationship between
the GPU, its displays and the active arcan window manager, many operations
depend on asynchronous operations on the GPU. To avoid triggering undefined
behaviors in the GL graphics API or causing severe performance degradation due
to artificially triggered pipeline stalls, virtual file system operations are
deferred until a point where current pipeline has been synchronized with the
output displays.

The other problem is that the FUSE driver itself is very poor at caching
lookups. This means that actions such as listing a directory may contain
multiple operations that will repeatedly run into the synchronization problem
above.

.SH SECURITY
Since this tool can be used to automate and explore contents of the active
window manager, it has far reaching privacy and security implications. It is up
to the user to make sure that only the ones that should have this capability
has access to the mount point and the file system.

.SH OPTIONS
All arguments can be listed via the '-h' or '--help' command line switch,
the exact details will vary with the FUSE implementation on your system.

There is one necessary argument, and that is --control. This should point to
the control domain socket used by the window manager to implement the
underlying protocol and data format.
