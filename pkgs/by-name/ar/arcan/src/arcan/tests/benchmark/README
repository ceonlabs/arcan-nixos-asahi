The benchmark applications in this folder all follows the
same pattern, see fillrate/fillrate.lua for an example.

They build on the scripts/benchmark.lua support script
that works by collecting display timing data for a number
of frames, doing a test if the framerate is above a
cutoff-point, and if so, increases the load. Thus, to use
you need to set the resource path:

arcan -p /path/to/arcan/tests /path/to/benchmark/test

the load- function is defined by each single tests and
the default output (report) is to standard output
in a CSV format e.g.

count:min:max:avg:stddev

Together with the feedgnuplot util, the logcomp script
in utils can be used to plot and compare testcases between
different runs.
