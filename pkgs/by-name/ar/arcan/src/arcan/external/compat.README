Compatibility Strategy:

Arcan as a display server is protocol-less. There is an highly volatile API
for segmenting the server into multiple-processes and a selection of in-house
maintained backends that use this API to connect, draw and retrieve input.

This means that with new versions, new updates to this API will need a full
recompile to existing backends in order to remain usable, meaning that they
should be updated 'in lockstep' with the main engine. This makes the API unfit
- by design - for use by other projects, with the exception of the TUI library
that is intended for 3rd party use.

The maintained backends and their repositories are:

SDL2:
https://github.com/letoram/SDL2.git
( may need to explicitly specify SDL_VIDEODRIVER=arcan SDL_AUDIORIVER=arcan )

Xarcan:
https://github.com/letoram/xarcan.git
( see the README for compilation instructions )

QEmu
https://github.com/letoram/QEMU.git
(	activated with the -display arcan argument )

In order to allow clients and toolkits written for other APIs and protocols
to be used, we also have bridging tools that are given special consideration.

The maintained bridging tools are:
Waybridge (src/tools/waybridge)
