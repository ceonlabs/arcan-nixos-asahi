The FLEXIBLE test checks for race-conditions related
to the resize operation, particulary in odd cases where
we might attempt to flip-flop PBOs with varying sizes
or starve other frameservers.

There is no built-in protection mechanism for excessive
resizes at the moment, the principle place for a check/kill
would be in the event-handler in the active script
(i.e. a global resize limit and a local resize/tick limit).

A compromise would be to have a template/wrapper handler
script that implements such a limit and let the security
concious developer take care of it there -- or possibly better,
have a priority/resource limit scheme for a frameserver
and then implement it in the engine.
