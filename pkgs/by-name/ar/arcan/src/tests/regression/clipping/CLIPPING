This tests the number of driver issues we've had with
various clipping methods, with the exception of performance.
For that, see the test in benchmark.

1. Two objects, one clipped shallow to the other.
2. Two objects, one clipped shallow with rotate against the parent.
3. Two objects, one clipped shallow with both rotated.
4. Three objects, a -> b [clip disable] -> c
5. Three objects, all clipped in hierarchy, rotated.
