Each test in this folder (arcan will be invoked with
 -t tests/regression as primary argument and an
 APPL_TEMP set to a temporary folder) is expected to
 be a fully qualified arcan appl with a manually verified
 and correct screenshot (even for tests with a non-visual 
 result, the image also acts as an identifier of sorts).

A correct run is identified by:
 a. an exit code of EXIT_SUCCESS ( call return shutdown() )
 b. A screenshot file with a name that match the first argument 
    (arguments[1]) provided, which will be randomized. This 
    image should approximately match the verified screenshot.
